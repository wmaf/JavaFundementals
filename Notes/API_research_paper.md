API (Application Programming Interface.) defined as, a framework that allows different machines and software connect to each other.  APIs have been around for a very long time. But their widespread usage began around the Dot-com bubble. 
APIs are used to access applications, servers, databases, and websites through one of the Architectures and protocols noted below.  However, there may be other configuration steps (Such as network routing) needed outside of the API for connectivity to function.  APIs can also refer to an interface to a local host, or to the library itself.
API Types:
•	Web, Open, Internal, Partner and composite
API Protocols:
•	REST, JSON-RPC and XML-RPC, SOAP and CRUD
With REST over HTML with JSON being the most popular.  
When using APIs, one should always consider their proper use.  I found a great resource API design guidelines at: https://www.swift.org/documentation/api-design-guidelines/
•	Although Swift is a different programing language the concepts promoted there fit snugly into Java Programming as well.
In brief, APIs are a set of instructions describing how one system can communicate with another system.  they reduce the amount of work, code and configuration needed to connect to a resource.  APIs limit the extent to which a system's functionality is exposed, to other systems and users.  APIs can be monetized into separate revenue streams or published (0pen) for public use
