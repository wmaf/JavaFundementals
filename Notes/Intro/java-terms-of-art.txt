Define the terms:

Method:
A method is a function that is part of o class.

Class:
Is a container of one or more related functions.

Function:
The smallest building block in Java is a function.  A function is a block of code that performs a task.

Field:  //Not in this lesson//

Variable: //Not in this lesson//

Access Modifier:
Access modifiers enable you to limit how programmers access given classes. This actually fulfills a key principle of object-oriented programming—encapsulation.


Define the terms in relation to each other. ie a method is a function, defined within an object…a function is…
The smallest building block in Java is a function.  A function is a block of code that performs a task.
A function consist of a ReturnType (such as "void") and  aName(itsParameters) {andJavaCode}.
Each Java program should have an entry point "main(){}"  whenever a Java program is executed it runs the code within the "main".  The main function must belong to a "class"  the class for main is: Main{} note that M is capatialized (uses PNC) and Main is preceded with curley braces.
Preceding the  class and returnType ia an access modifier which is a keyword placed before attributes, methods, or classes to manage how they're accessed (restrictions).
Access modifiers are also sometimes referred to as visibility modifiers.
Visibility modifiers enable you to limit how programmers access given classes. This actually fulfills a
PNC = Pascal Naming Convention (Classes)
CNC = Camel Naming Convention (methods)
---------------------------------------------Modifiers---------------------------------------------------
Default:
When you don't explicitly define a modifier, the Java compiler will use the default visibility access. So only classes in the same package as the defined class can access its variables or methods.
Public:
This modifier allows members of a class to be accessed in all packages. Simply put, you can access them everywhere. The public modifier provides the least restrictive level of access.
Protected:
Allows members of a class to be accessed within the class and its sub-classes. It can provide access outside a package only through inheritance. Unlike the two previous modifiers, protected "can only be used with members of a class, not the class itself."
Private:
This modifier allows members of a class to only be accessed within the class.
